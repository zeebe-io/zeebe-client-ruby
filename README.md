# Zeebe Ruby Client

![Build Status](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-client-ruby/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

[Zeebe](https://zeebe.io) client containing a simple wrapper for the GRPC protocol used by Zeebe.

## General Usage

Install the gem:

    gem install zeebe-client

Run a Zeebe instance locally:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 26500:26500 camunda/zeebe:8.1.12
```

And then try the available [demo script](examples/demo.rb).

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.

## Development

The `gen-grpc.sh` script can be used to generate Ruby code for the Zeebe proto.

To start Zeebe locally for running the integration tests use:

```sh
bundle exec rake zeebe:start
bundle exec rake spec
bundle exec rake zeebe:stop
```

To retrieve the latest GRPC proto from the Zeebe repository:

```sh
wget -O proto/gateway.proto https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camunda/zeebe/develop/gateway-protocol/src/main/proto/gateway.proto
```
